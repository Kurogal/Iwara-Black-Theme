If you've never used a UserStyle before, use Stylus for it: 
https://github.com/openstyles/stylus#readme

It works on every browser that supports extensions I checked, though Android Firefox (Nightly) and things based on it will be a bit involved if you haven't set custom extensions yet. And noremal firefox only allows their set list.

After you got that installed just click on the raw file on the css and it'll prompt you to install it.
Or if you just want a direct link to it:
